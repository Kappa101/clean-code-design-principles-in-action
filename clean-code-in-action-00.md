### Clean Code and Design Principles in Action: 
### develop quality applications, faster
As developers, we often feel that we are always asked for more: more
features, more bugfixes, more code to get our application done,
faster. In the workshop you'll learn first hand how applying Clean
Code and Design Principles will help you complete solid & maintainable
applications in less time.

# ABSTRACT
We are often asked for more features, more bugfixes, faster. But is
"running" always the fastest way to get things done?
For a mountain climber, "running" means more mistakes, falling off
more often,thus proceeding more slowly.

So like a climber gets to the top through a continuous chain of small,
safe steps, we can improve coding by making design & implementation
steps clean, safe and incremental.

In the workshop, starting from concrete examples, you will learn first
hand how applying Clean Code and Design Principles will help you
complete more solid & maintainable applications in less time



## AUDIENCE
Basically, to all developers! Independently from the language /
platform you are developing on, and from your expertise level, if you
are interested in improving your approach to coding, and develop
higher quality applications with more productivity, this workshop is
for you.



## PREREQUISITES
Working knowledge and practical experience in one programming language
(you should be able to write/compile/test/debug by yourself a program
which reads and parses input and presents output either on the command
line or in a simple GUI).
Basic knowledge of HTTP.



## HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
* Participants are required to bring their own laptop. The labs require an HTML5 Browser (Chrome or Firefox), text editor or IDE, supporting HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

* Modern Browser (Chrome - Firefox)

Text Editor (Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code,...) 
* http://brackets.io/
* http://atom.io

and/or IDE (Eclipse,  NetBeans, Intellij, Visual Studio,.. )
* http://www.eclipse.org
* http://netbeans.org
* WebStorms / Visual Studio Community

* ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer`` vs https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/



# TOPICS
* How does our code become unmanageable? A practical example
* What can we do about that? 
  * Clean Code, Design Principles and Lean to the rescue
* Clean Code by example: key concepts
  * Concept 1 - Naming
  * Concept 2 - Formatting
  * Concept 3 - What's in a good function?
  * Concept 4 - What's in a good class? Design Principles



# Topics
  * Concept 5 - Making our code Testable
  * Concept 6 - Making debug and troubleshooting easier
  * Concept 7 - Refactoring
* The principles: quality vs productivity - continuous safe steps
* Incremental development and evolutionary design
* A more complex example - applying the method to real-world problems
* How to continue by yourself: references for further learning



## Approach
For each module, hands-on lab will include
- quizzes (which of these variants is better? trade-offs)
- interactive examples to complete and modify in an online IDE
